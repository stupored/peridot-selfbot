input your details into the config.json

run: python3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self
run: chmod -R 777 ./

debug any issues u find from there idk it was ran on Ubuntu 21.04, youll figure it out

USAGE:
python3 peridot.py
or
nohup python3 peridot.py &

nohup allows the server to be disconnected to and still remain active etc

NOTE:
this was debugged, created, and ran on Ubuntu 21.04, no guarantee it will work on windows or any other os
ICMP method in code is used for ddos, low effort method that uses 9-14% cpu and 90mb/s outbound, super lowkey easy to use and
wont get you banned on many hosts, because of this it is semi shitty. dont expect to down anything more then a shitty home with icmp on 
or u will be severely dissapointed 
the code is shitty, dont talk shit ab it. you downloaded it..
this was not made for you, but for me. published out of pity.

config:
in the config you will find token, prefix, embed, nitro sniper, logger
for token paste your token into the quotations, for example: "exampletoken"
for prefix enter a character you want as your bots prefix, prefix is used for cmds, default is "."
for nitro sniper, leaving true will run the sniper passively and will try to steal nitro, false turns it off
for logger, leave empty unless you have a users ID you would like to log
furthermore on logger, the logger logs all msgs sent from that ID but only in the servers you are mutual in from the person, dms included
for embed leaving true will make all commands except for a few, embedded, turn off to allow all commands except a few be un embedded

peridot was made out of curiousity for python, its shit and half assed. use it or dont, but..
if u r reading this, then you downloaded it so please share and leave a like on the github repo: https://github.com/stupored
means a lot and any comments left for specific things will be added thru enough support.
